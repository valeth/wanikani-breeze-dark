# WaniKani Breeze Dark Theme

[![Install directly with Stylus][stylus_badge]][usercss]
[![pipeline status][pipeline_badge]][commits]

A theme for the WaniKani website using the [KDE Breeze](https://hig.kde.org/style/color/dark.html) theme color palette.

Requires the Stylus browser extension.

## How to build it yourself

### The ruby way

> Only required if you want to have the latest development version.

You need:

- git (obviously)
- ruby (for the gem and rake commands)

Run `gem install bundler` to install the bundler program.

> Make sure `bundle` is in your PATH,
> `gem` should warn you if it isn't.

Run `bundle install` from within the project directory.

Then run `rake` from within the project directory and install
the generated `compiled/wanikani_breeze_dark.user.css` with Stylus.

### The docker way

It's possible to build (and develop) the project without having the environment on your machine. Simply run `make compile` from repository root - this will build the CSS styles using a docker container. To continuously work on the style and automatically recompile while making changes run `make watch`. To check for code style errors before commiting run `make lint`.

## Info for user script creators

This style provides CSS custom properties that can be used by UI generated by user scripts. The properties are:

- `--kanji-color` - color used to denote kanji
- `--radical-color` - color used to denote radicals
- `--vocabulary-color` - color used to denote vocabulary
- `--text-color` - default text color; light text od dark background
- `--inverted-text-color` - dark text color, can be used on kanji/radical/vocabulary backgrounds
- `--page-background` - background color of the WK pages
- `--section-background` - background color of WK sections/panels
